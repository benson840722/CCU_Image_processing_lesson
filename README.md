# CCU Image processing lesson 
"Statement: 
All image processing operations are implemented using Python."
Do not use built-in functions; please implement what you have learned in the course.

Use NumPy and OpenCV to complete the following assignment.

In HW1, apply the Laplacian operator, unsharp masking, and high-boost filtering to the original image.

In HW 2, convert the original RGB image to the HSI and LAB color spaces.

In HW 3, apply Gaussian blur, Laplacian sharpening, and Sobel edge detection.
